<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Relief Valve Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Spring-Type</li><li>Lever-Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The relief valve market is primarily segmented into two types: spring-type and lever-type. Spring-type relief valves use a predetermined spring force to maintain pressure thresholds, releasing excess pressure automatically when needed. They are compact and widely used in various industries. Lever-type relief valves, on the other hand, utilize a lever mechanism to provide a mechanical advantage for releasing built-up pressure. This type is often favored for applications requiring higher flow rates and manual operation. Both types play crucial roles in ensuring system safety and efficiency.</p></p>
